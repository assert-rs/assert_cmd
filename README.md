`assert_cmd` aims to simplify the process for doing integration testing of CLIs, including:
- Finding your crate's binary to test
- Assert on the result of your program's run.

## Example

Here's a trivial example:

```rust,no_run
use assert_cmd::Command;

let mut cmd = Command::cargo_bin("bin_fixture").unwrap();
cmd.assert().success();
```

See the [docs](http://docs.rs/assert_cmd) for more.

## Relevant crates

Other crates that might be useful in testing command line programs.
* [escargot][escargot] for more control over configuring the crate's binary.
* [duct][duct] for orchestrating multiple processes.
  * or [commandspec] for easier writing of commands
* [rexpect][rexpect] for testing interactive programs.
* [`assert_fs`][assert_fs] for filesystem fixtures and assertions.
  * or [tempfile][tempfile] for scratchpad directories.
* [dir-diff][dir-diff] for testing file side-effects.
* [cross][cross] for cross-platform testing.

> bravo bravo WG-cli

passcod
> Running commands and dealing with output can be complex in many many ways, so assert_cmd smoothing that is excellent, very much welcome, and improves ergonomics significantly.

>  I have used [assert_cmd] in other projects and I am extremely pleased with it

coreyja
> [assert_cmd] pretty much IS my testing strategy so far, though my app under test is pretty small.
>
> This library has made it really easy to add some test coverage to my project, even when I am just learning how to write Rust!
